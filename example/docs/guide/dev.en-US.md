### Development Process

It is recommended to use `pnpm` as a package management tool.

After you clone the dumi-theme-chaos code and use:

<InstallDependencies
  pnpm='$ pnpm install'
  npm='$ npm install'
  yarn='$ yarn'
/>

After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the development mode.

<InstallDependencies
  pnpm='$ pnpm run start'
  npm='$ npm run start'
  yarn='$ yarn run start'
/>

Modify `/src` to debug the files in the directory.
