### Development Process

It is recommended to use `pnpm` as a package management tool.

After you clone the dumi-theme-chaos code and use:
:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
$ pnpm install
```

```bash [npm] 
$ npm install
```

```bash [yarn]
$ yarn
```
:::

After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the development mode. 

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
$ pnpm run start
```

```bash [npm] 
$ npm run start
```

Modify `/src` to debug the files in the directory.
